## My Academic Journey and Research Experiences
### A Childhood Fascination with the Cosmos
Looking up at the open sky, observing celestial phenomena from the unindustrialized outskirts of my hometown in southern India, left a profound and magnetic impact on me. It ignited a deep curiosity about the universe and a quest for knowledge on various astronomical phenomena.

Driven by this passion, I have been searching for a program that offers an opportunity to study Gravitation and Cosmology, Stellar Astrophysics, and Exoplanets in an intellectually stimulating and culturally diverse environment. The EMJMD Masters in Astrophysics and Space Science (MASS) program aligns perfectly with these aspirations, providing an enriching experience through international collaborations and exposures.

### Diverse Learning and Cultural Exposure at Delhi University
My undergraduate journey at Delhi University was marked by significant cultural and academic transitions. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, my first semester took place entirely online. Moving to Delhi in my second semester was a challenging yet exciting experience, as I encountered extreme weather conditions and cultural differences. However, my enthusiasm for physics and the opportunity to interact with peers from across India outweighed these challenges.
Aprilâ€™s intense summer heat was difficult to adapt to, but the unwavering support from friends and family, along with my long-cherished practice of yoga, helped me overcome these difficulties. My daily yoga sessions became a source of inspiration for my hostel roommates and friends, many of whom started practicing with me as I volunteered to teach them.

#### Academic and Cultural Immersion
During my undergraduate studies, I had the privilege of working with students from diverse backgrounds. I collaborated closely with peers from different linguistic and academic backgrounds during lab sessions. These experiences honed my ability to communicate technical concepts effectively, seek guidance, and offer assistance when needed.

Beyond academics, my hostel life provided a rich multicultural experience. Living alongside students from Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and South Africa, I engaged in meaningful discussions over meals and participated in cultural events showcasing diverse traditions. One particularly memorable experience was assisting an Afghan friend in my hostel when she fell ill. I ensured she received meals, medication, and emotional support, reinforcing my belief in empathy, inclusivity, and cross-cultural friendships.

#### Volunteering and Teaching Experience
One of the most fulfilling experiences of my undergraduate journey was volunteering to teach mathematics and science to local students. As a South Indian, conversing in Hindi, a predominant language in North India, was initially a challenge. However, my early exposure to Hindi through television series like Mahabharat and Ramayan helped me grasp the language quickly within my first few months in college.

Teaching became a rewarding experience, not only enhancing my students' knowledge but also deepening my own understanding. The curiosity of young minds, reflected in their thought-provoking questions, often left me amazed at their potential. This experience instilled in me a strong commitment to mentorship and the importance of providing educational resources to underprivileged students.

Many of my relatives in my hometown often questioned my decision to study in Delhi, citing cultural and lifestyle differences. My response was always inspired by an old Kannada saying: "Desha sutti nodu, kosha odi nodu", which translates to "Explore the world and indulge yourself in books to become a better individual." Studying in a multicultural city like Delhi has given me the confidence that I can adapt and thrive in any part of the world.

### ISRO-ISITE Internship â€“ A Step Towards My Dream
Interning at ISROâ€™s Space Astronomy Group (SAG department) was a dream come true, albeit partiallyâ€”I aspire to contribute to ISRO as a researcher after completing my PhD. ISRO is Indiaâ€™s leading space research center, housing cutting-edge technology and brilliant scientists.

During my two-month internship, I had the privilege of interacting with renowned scientists such as Dr. Shankar Subramanian, Dr. Radhakrishna V, and Dr. Anuj Nandi. Their insights were truly inspirational. One moment that particularly stood out was when I expressed my concerns to Dr. Radhakrishna about not being able to complete my project within the given timeframe. He reassured me, saying that the true essence of research lies not in meeting deadlines but in the depth of learning and insights gained. His words shifted my focus from completion to understanding, and to my surprise, I not only finished the project but also developed a deeper curiosity about solar flares. This newfound interest motivated me to continue my research independently.

### Independent Research â€“ A Journey of Self-Discovery
Embarking on independent research has been one of the most enriching experiences of my academic journey. The initial months were thrilling, I learned to use XSPEC, explored Ubuntu, WSL, and experimented with data analysis techniques like background subtraction and different modeling methods. However, as I progressed, moments of self-doubt crept in.

A pivotal turning point came when I attended the 'Astronomy from the Moon' conference at the Raman Research Institute (RRI). Engaging with leading astrophysicists and exploring novel research avenues reinvigorated my confidence. A particularly impactful conversation with Dr. Seetha provided me with invaluable guidance. When I asked her how one identifies the right field of research, she responded with a personal anecdote, emphasizing that true passion is when one becomes so immersed in work that time ceases to exist. Her words reassured me that I was on the right path, fueling my determination to persist in my research.

Currently, I am expanding my work by incorporating MSS-1B and SDO (AIA) data to explore elemental abundance evolution studies, further deepening my understanding of the multifaceted nature of solar flares. Additionally, I am taking courses in general relativity in astrophysics, Bayesian statistics, and machine learning to expand my knowledge and skill sets required for modern-day astrophysics research.

#### International Collaboration in Research â€“ Solving a Calibration Challenge
While working on the calibration of MSS-1B data, I encountered a significant challenge in calculating detector efficiency due to a lack of access to crucial mass attenuation constants. With my supervisor unavailable, I turned to references cited in the MSS-1B calibration research paper for potential leads.

This search led me to the work of Dr. E. M. Gullikson, whose research utilized the exact constants I needed. I reached out to him via email, explaining my challenge and seeking guidance. To my surprise, Dr. Gullikson responded and provided the necessary guidance, enabling me to successfully complete the calibration.

This experience underscored the importance of international collaboration in astrophysics research. It reinforced my belief that scientific progress thrives on global knowledge exchange and that reaching out to experts can be instrumental in overcoming research hurdles.

#### Expanding My Research Horizons
My exposure to X-ray studies on solar flares has sparked a growing interest in the application of X-ray astronomy to study compact objects such as black holes. As a result, I have been delving into research on magnetars, particularly the work of Dr. Ilaria Caiazzo at ISTA. Her study "**[Polarized X-rays from a Magnetar](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.add0080)**"â€”which utilizes IXPE's polarization data to explore resonant cyclotron scattering and QED vacuum birefringence, has been especially captivating. I aspire to explore this field further, leveraging my skills and experiences to contribute meaningfully to astrophysics research.

### Conclusion
Through my academic journey, cultural exposure, research experiences, and international collaborations, I have developed the resilience, adaptability, and curiosity necessary to thrive in an interdisciplinary and diverse academic environment. The MASS program's commitment to international collaboration, cutting-edge research, and cultural diversity perfectly aligns with my aspirations. I am eager to contribute to and grow within this dynamic community, furthering my passion for astrophysics on a global scale.
